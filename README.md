Quiz with React and Typescript, originally followed along with [React / Typescript Tutorial - Build a Quiz App](https://youtu.be/F2JCjVSZlG0) from freeCodeCamp, then started adjusting styling and will add more to it over time.

- Improve accessibility / update colors
- Different quizzes for different categories
- Share your score

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
